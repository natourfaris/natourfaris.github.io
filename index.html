<p>I am a Statistical Analyst at Aviva Canada. Previously, I completed a BComm in Finance from the University of Toronto Mississauga in 2014 and an MA in Economics from the University of Toronto (St. George; 2015). I am interested in economics (labour and urban), international relations, history, hockey (Leafs), and soccer (Barca). The easiest way to reach me is my email: natourfaris (AT) gmail (DOT) com. I also tweet extensively <a href="https://twitter.com/pressFToTweet">@pressFToTweet</a>.</p>
